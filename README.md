# Horse-and-Human-classification-with-Tensorflow
•	Step 1:Starting with OS library to use Operating System libraries, giving you access to the file system, and the zipfile library allowing you to unzip the data.    
•	Step 2:Import tensorflow.             
•	Step 3: Adding convolutions                                                              
•	Step 4: Using optimizers and loss function																										
•	Step 5: Data preprocessing
•	Step 6: Training
•	Step 7:Running the model
